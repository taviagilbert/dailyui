# Daily UI Challenge: A 100-Day Journey in Design & Code

This repository documents my 100-day journey through the Daily UI challenge. It serves as a living portfolio of my design and front-end development skills, with each project built as a functional, interactive web experience.

## Project Goal

The primary goal of this project is to consistently practice and improve core design and development skills. By tackling a new and unique UI each day, I aim to:

* **Sharpen Design Intuition**: Experiment with layout, typography, color theory, and user experience across a wide variety of components.
* **Strengthen Technical Proficiency**: Build each design using fundamental web technologies, focusing on clean, efficient, and responsive code.
* **Build a Diverse Portfolio**: Create a public collection of 100 distinct UI projects that demonstrate versatility and a commitment to continuous learning.
